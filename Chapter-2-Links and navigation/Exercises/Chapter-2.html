    <p>Struggling doorknob salesman Steve breaks into a mine to fulfill a childhood dream when he discovers the Orb of Dominance and the Earth Crystal. When combined, they create a portal that transports him to the Overworld, an alternate dimension where the terrain is made of easily manipulated cubes. He builds his own paradise and later stumbles across a portal to a hellish world called the Nether. He is imprisoned by Malgosha, the gold-obsessed piglin ruler of the Nether who hates creativity. Because the Orb would allow her to control the Overworld, Steve has his dog Dennis hide it and the Crystal under his bed in the real world.

        Some time later, 1980s video game champion Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison owns a failing video game store in Chuglass, Idaho. He heads to a storage auction to acquire items to sell for cash, ultimately winning the contents of Steve's old house. While searching through the items, particularly hoping to find a valuable Atari Cosmos, he instead finds the Orb of Dominance and the Earth Crystal.
        
        Siblings Henry and Natalie move to Chuglass following their mother's death. The two meet Dawn, their real estate agent who wants to open a petting zoo. On Henry's first day of school, he gets in trouble when his makeshift jetpack malfunctions and destroys a mascot statue. To avoid trouble, he pretends that Garrett is his uncle, who takes him to the video game store to discuss his options. There, Henry combines the Orb and Crystal, leading the two to the mine. Natalie is worried and calls Dawn, who accesses Henry's location with Natalie's phone. All four of them ultimately enter the portal and arrive in the Overworld. Malgosha is alerted that the Orb has returned – she releases Steve from his prison in the Nether to reclaim it, bluffing that she holds his dog hostage.
        
        While fighting off monsters at night, Henry learns how to build and makes a wooden fortress. The Earth Crystal is destroyed in the commotion. Steve appears at dawn and defeats the monsters. He says that a replacement Crystal will be needed from the Woodland Mansion. To prepare, he leads them to a nearby village and shows them how to craft. However, piglins launch a raid on the village. Steve, Garrett, and Henry narrowly escape, but Natalie and Dawn are separated and discover Dennis. Malgosha responds by sending out the Great Hog.
        
        When Steve mentions that he has a large hoard of diamonds, Garrett becomes interested and demands access as an added condition of handing over the Orb. They find the hoard, but Henry is angered by the detour and worries about Natalie's safety. When the Great Hog arrives, they flee using minecarts and the Hog is blown up by creepers. Arriving at the mansion, Steve and Garrett attempt to distract the inhabitant pillagers while Henry acquires both the Earth Crystal and an Ender Pearl, which can facilitate one teleport. Malgosha returns and blows up the bridge to the mansion. Steve and Henry lose the Orb but escape as Garrett seemingly sacrifices himself in the blast. The two awaken with Dawn, Natalie, and Dennis in a mushroom house they built.
        
        Malgosha uses the Orb to superpower the Nether portal, blotting out the sun and declaring war on the Overworld. The party crafts an arsenal of weapons and an army of iron golems that meet the invading force. Henry throws the Ender Pearl to teleport to the Crystal. Seizing it restores the sunlight, causing the piglins to zombify and die. Defeated, Malgosha unsuccessfully attempts to attack Steve before he leaves her to die as well. Henry is rescued by Garrett, who had previously survived by riding a flying ghast. The party returns to Chuglass, where they create the successful video game Block City Battle Buddies. Dawn opens her zoo with Dennis as an attraction, Natalie begins teaching self-defense classes, Henry completes his jetpack, and Steve and Garrett operate the game store.</p>

        <p class="Review-Box">Absolutely life changing!

            From the moment the opening scene lit up the screen, I knew A Minecraft Movie was going to be something truly special. As a longtime fan of the game, I went in with high hopes—but what I experienced was beyond anything I could have imagined. This film isn’t just a video game adaptation; it’s a love letter to the creativity, adventure, and endless possibilities that Minecraft represents. It’s a thrilling, heartwarming, and visually stunning journey that captures the essence of the game while telling a story that resonates with both die-hard fans and newcomers alike.
            
            A Faithful Yet Fresh Take on the Minecraft Universe
            One of my biggest worries was whether the movie would stay true to the spirit of Minecraft while still offering something new. I’m thrilled to say it absolutely does! The world-building is phenomenal—every blocky tree, every creeper lurking in the shadows, every sprawling biome feels like it...

        <!--Paragraph about the game-->
        <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus Persson, also known as "Notch," and released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009. After gradual updates and development, Mojang officially released the game on November 18, 2011.

        In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world, discovering and extracting raw materials, crafting tools and items, and building structures or earthworks. Depending on the game mode, players can also fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world.

        Minecraft features several game modes, including survival mode, where players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health; creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access to flight; adventure mode, where players can play custom maps created by other players with certain restrictions; and spectator mode, where players can freely move throughout a world without being affected by gravity or world mechanics.

        The game is one of the best-selling video games of all time, with over 200 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021. Its cultural impact is massive, inspiring educational tools, merchandise, books, conventions, and now a feature film adaptation.</p>

        <!--Paragraph with information about the developers of the game-->
        <p>Minecraft was originally developed by Markus "Notch" Persson as an independent project. He started work on the game in May 2009 and released it to the public as a developmental release.

        After its early success, Notch founded Mojang Studios, which continued the development and expansion of the game. Jens Bergensten, also known as "Jeb," took over lead development from Notch in 2011. Under Jeb's leadership, Minecraft grew with the addition of new features, improved mechanics, and ports to various platforms including consoles and mobile devices.

        Mojang Studios was acquired by Microsoft in 2014 for $2.5 billion. Since then, Mojang has continued to develop Minecraft alongside other projects, working with partner studios to bring the game to new audiences and maintaining its strong community presence.
