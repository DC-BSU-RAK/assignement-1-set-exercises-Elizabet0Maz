        <p>Minecraft was originally developed by Markus "Notch" Persson as an independent project. He started work on the game in May 2009 and released it to the public as a developmental release.

        After its early success, Notch founded Mojang Studios, which continued the development and expansion of the game. Jens Bergensten, also known as "Jeb," took over lead development from Notch in 2011. Under Jeb's leadership, Minecraft grew with the addition of new features, improved mechanics, and ports to various platforms including consoles and mobile devices.

        Mojang Studios was acquired by Microsoft in 2014 for $2.5 billion. Since then, Mojang has continued to develop Minecraft alongside other projects, working with partner studios to bring the game to new audiences and maintaining its strong community presence.

        Major contributors to Minecraft include:
