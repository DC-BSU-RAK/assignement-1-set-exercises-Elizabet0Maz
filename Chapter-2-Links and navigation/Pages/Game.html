        <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus Persson, also known as "Notch," and released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009. After gradual updates and development, Mojang officially released the game on November 18, 2011.

        In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world, discovering and extracting raw materials, crafting tools and items, and building structures or earthworks. Depending on the game mode, players can also fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world.

        Minecraft features several game modes, including survival mode, where players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health; creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access to flight; adventure mode, where players can play custom maps created by other players with certain restrictions; and spectator mode, where players can freely move throughout a world without being affected by gravity or world mechanics.

        The game is one of the best-selling video games of all time, with over 200 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021. Its cultural impact is massive, inspiring educational tools, merchandise, books, conventions, and now a feature film adaptation.</p>
