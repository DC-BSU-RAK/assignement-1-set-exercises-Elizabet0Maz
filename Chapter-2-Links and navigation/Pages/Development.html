        <p class="Left-Aligned">On February 27, 2014, Notch posted on Twitter that Mojang Studios' partnership with Warner Bros. about a Minecraft film was being "leaked", saying that he wanted to be the one to leak it out. That same day, it was reported that Roy Lee and Jill Messick were added as producers.</p>

Later that same month, it was reported that Shawn Levy would direct the film, but soon left the project along with Kieran and Michele Mulroney, who were serving as writers, due to creative differences and scheduling conflicts. It was reported that Levy and the Mulroneys' vision for the film didn't mesh well with what Mojang was looking for. Levy would later state in an interview that he envisioned a Minecraft film as an adventure movie with a Goonies flair.</p>

The film was taken off the release schedule as a result of the replacement.
